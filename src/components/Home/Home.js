							Reading is Part of Your Success

							Education never ends, neither after school nor after getting the job of your dreams. Our life is a continuous learning process, although some of us may not be conscious of this.

							I have always looked up to successful people as I wanted to be one of them, so I analyzed their lifestyles thoroughly. It was no surprise to discover that they always make time to read, study and learn far beyond their grade school. Thatâ€™s why they became great thinkers, innovators and leaders.
